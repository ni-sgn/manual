# The Foundation of Arithmetic
### Frege
"
Never, then, let us suppose that the essence of the matter lies in such
ideas.
Never let us take a description of the origin of an idea for a 
definition, or an account of the mental and physical conditions on which
we become conscious of a proposition for a proof of it.
"

"
If everything were were in continual flux, and nothing maintained itself
fixed for all time, there would no longer be any possibility of getting 
to know anything about the world and everything would be plunged with
confusion.
"

"
Do the concepts, as we approach their supposed sources, reveal
themselves in peculiar purity? Not at all;
We see everything as through a fog, blurred and undifferentiated.
"

"
No less essential for mathematics than the refusal of all assistance
from the direction of psychology, is the recognition of its close
connexion with logic.
I go so far as to agree with those who hold that it is impossible 
to effect any shart separation of the two.
"

"
Even I agree that definitions must show their worth by their 
fruitfulness: it must be possible to use them for constructing proofs.
"

"
I have kept three fundamental principles:<br/>
	always to separate sharply the psychological from the logical,
the subjective from the objective;
	never to ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only
in the context of a proposition; 
	never to lose sight of the distinctino between concept and
object;
"

"
Later developments, however, have shown more and more clearly that in
mathematics a mere moral conviction, supported by a mass of successful
applications, is not good enough. Proof is now demanded of many things
that formerly passed as self-evident.
"

"
The aim of proof is, in fact, not merely to place the truth of a 
proposition beyond all doubt, but also to afford us insight into the 
dependence of truths upon one another.
"

"
Arithmetical truths - are they a priori or a posteriori? synthetic or 
analytic? 
"

"
It not uncommonly happnes that we first discover the content
of a proposition, and only later give the rigorous proof of it, on
other and more difficultlines; and often this same proof also reveals
more precisely the conditions restricting the validity of the 
proposition. In general, therefore, the question of how we arrive
at the content of a judgement should be kept distinct from the other 
question, Whence do we derive the justification for its assertion?
"

It's weird how normal people act. People who act out of boundaries are
very few. They follow the stream of life or maybe ideology as a norm
but why is it a norm?

a+b=c
c is a sum
a + b is an addition
+ is a plus sign

"three methods of solving an equation." The thing here is that numbers
can be applied to things that can't be imagined, like if you say three
dots, it can be imagined.

"If the definition of each individual number did really assert a specia
physical fact, then we should never be able sufficiently to admire, for
his knowledge of nature, a man who calculates with nine-figure numbers.
