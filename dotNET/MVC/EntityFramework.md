### Little intro
Framework is like extended standard library... Makes working with the
system easier and supports multiple languages...  

Framework includes API, which makes sense because framework creates
additional logic which wraps API functionality and makes working with 
the system easier.

SDK is like an interface which emulates some system and makes possible
to write applications for another system and framework...

Middleware extends the services provided by the operating system.
"those services found above the transport (i.e. over TCP/IP) layer
set of services but below the application environment".(i.e. below
application level APIs).

Basically we are writing application and are provided with middleware,
which are HTTPS handlers, Database abstractions and so on and so on...
