From learners perspective if one reads two unknown words from which
one is a verb and other is a noun,no real distinction exists to separate
this two. 

In this case words are words, you just have to have the knowledge of 
the meaning of a word.
<br/>
But in sentences verbs usually are more lively, they morph, try to adapt
to the environment.

# Action -> Target of an Action -> Result of an Action
What resulted in creation of verbs and nouns? Is it the laws of the
universe, because there exist things and things that can be done
to those things.
<br/>
Evolutionarily speaking, in my opinion what language is trying to
do is sentences to be compact and still be able to hold as much data as 
possible. 
<br/>
In this sense, I think that the concepts of time and space that we have
today, were breakthroughs in language, when the problem of putting
more data in a verb was solved.
<br/>
Because 'enemy come' isnt enough to tell your friends that someone is
planning to attack you in three days from the north.

<br/>
Therefore, I think that, there might have been some concepts before
the language, which forced humans to utter words, but more concepts
were developed after the first utterence and many very important
concepts were the result of trying to improve the language. 

<br/>
Language was created as a weapon which utilizes the power of
intelligence.
<br/>
Maybe at some point group which had a better language won, because
of better coordionation and so on and so on...
<br/>
The urge to communicate must be very high to create something as
gigantic as the language is...
<br/>
But at some point something must have pushed humans to improve
and advance language, which as I said must be as important as survival.
<br/>
If humans understood the difference between the action and the target
of that action, would they implant that difference on word level?
In mathematics there is a difference between the function and a
variable(expression wise) and I think that mathematics sorts 
out and utilizes the concepts which were the result of the development
of the language.
<br/>
But I think in Russian differenciating between the verb and the noun
is always possible...
<br/>
time was invented to make verb more expressive/descriptive.
<br/>
space, color, size, smell, sound, texture ... were invented to make
nouns more expressive/descriptive. Because noun can be so many types,
changing noun according to them woudn't be practical so creating more
words works better.
