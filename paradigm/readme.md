***PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE***
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_model

***SYNTAX/GRAMMAR***
When does a language become a 'PROGRAMMING' language?
It must be formal, therefore it's well-defined.
To be formal language, you must have grammar/syntax.
This shapes the language from infinite possibilities.

***EXECUTION MODEL***
ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_model

Every concept that is implemented on a computer
must be executed on the CPU. 
We have a syntax/grammar of a language, but
what about the meaning, its semantics? 
When a programmer reads a programming language,
what should he expect? 

"The execution model specifies the behavior
of elements of the language."
"The implementation of an execution model can
be via compiler, or interpreter, and often includes
a runtime system."

###Units of work and scheduling###
How are the statements, instructions 
written in the programming language 
scheduled on the hardware(cpu and memory)...
This is basically what defines the semantics 
of a programming language and itself is defined
in the Execution model of that language.

***SEMANTICS***
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)

Formal Semantics of a Programming Language 
describes the proccesses of a computer follows
when executing program in that specific language.

"this can be shown by describing the relationship
between the input and output of a program, or an
explanation of how the program will be executed on
a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation."

###Model of Computation###
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computations syntactically valid, it describes certain computation

There are different models for computation.
I guess computation can happen in many ways.
This needs more research on what is computation
on its own,computational theory.
This is interesting but getting closer to a pure math.

For example, Turing machines and lambda calculus are
different computational models.

###Ontology###
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)

"What ontologies in both information science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities, ideas and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories."
....more research needed
