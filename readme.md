# General Principles

## All good things take time. (Preparation, Preservarion, Appriciation)

### Arrange, Act, Assert


### Reusability
No one wants to write same logic twice.
Generalization like in mathematics plays a big role.

### Responsiveness to Changes 
Everyone wants to have a least to change in a consequence of a change.

### Reading... Analysing
Chain of dependencies is hard to understand...
Temptation to understand the code in its entirety is an unreal
expectation, lookat the parts that you are interested in...
Descartian approach works better here...
<br/>
In OOP what confuses me is that its not easy to differenciate between
the classes of different level... What I mean by this is that, some 
classes are added for Language Features and tricks, some for Testing,
some for Accessability, and some for Business Logic...
Whatever it is, they are still implemented using classes and this
feels too spaggetti to me...


### Zero-overhead principle C++
What you don't use, you don't pay for,
What you do    use, you couldn't hand code any better.
