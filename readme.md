# General Principles

### Reading... 
Temptation to understand the code in its entirety is an unreal expectation, lookat the parts that you are interested in... Descartian approach works betterhere...

### Zero-overhead principle C++
What you don't use, you don't pay for,
What you do    use, you couldn't hand code any better.
