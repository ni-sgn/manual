FOR loop is generalized, more compact syntax 
than WHILE loop

in assembly, they are implemented in
exactly the same way

main: jump to .L2: checks condition jump to .L3
keeps repeating according to the condition

for(expr1; expr2; expr3){}

expr1 stays in the end of main:
expr2 is turned into condition check in .L2:
expr3 is added in the end of .L3:
